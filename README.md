# Condition-Codes-Jumps-Function-Calls
CPU Simulation for implementing Condition Codes, Jumps and Function Calls
Implemented 7 condition codes. Added codes to set them when they need to be. Executed at least six examples of setting each of the flags and their meaningful combinations.

Implemented jump instructions as it deem fit. Written a short do...while, while...do and for loops and demonstrated how you can use the instruction set to implement them.

Implement an LEA op code. 

Written a recursive function/procedure in C (or pseudocode) to implement a binary search over an array of integers. 

Executed this program on your implementation of The BEST CPU for six sets of searches per these four conditions:

1. Array has even or odd number of elements

2. Search on an element > middle of the array

3. Search on an element < middle of the array

4. Search on an element that is not in the array

Searches return the index into the array where the element exists or -1 if the element is not found in the array.
